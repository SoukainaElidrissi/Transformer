# Text Generation with GPT-2 Transformer

## 1. Setup and Pre-training

### Installation:
Install pytorch-transformers to leverage pre-trained models, particularly GPT-2.

### Load GPT-2 Pre-trained Model:
Load the GPT-2 pre-trained model using the pytorch-transformers library.

## 2. Fine-tuning

### Customized Dataset:
Create or utilize a customized dataset for fine-tuning GPT-2. This dataset should reflect the specific text generation task.

### Fine-tune GPT-2:
Follow the provided tutorial ([here](https://gist.github.com/mf1024/3df214d2f17f3dcc56450ddf0d5a4cd7)) to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your customized dataset.

## 3. Text Generation

### Given Sentence:
Provide a seed sentence or paragraph to the fine-tuned GPT-2 model for text generation.

### Generate New Paragraph:
Utilize the fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate a new paragraph based on the given sentence.

## Summary

This synthesis outlines the process of setting up and pre-training the GPT-2 model using pytorch-transformers, fine-tuning it on a customized dataset, and generating new text based on a given seed sentence. The tutorial provided in the gist offers step-by-step guidance for seamless implementation.
